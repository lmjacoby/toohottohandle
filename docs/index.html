    <p id="intro" style="margin: 0 0 10px 0">
    Every year in the US, millions of wildfire emerge and cause unimaginable damage to people and places. In this first narrative we are going to
    explore the size and location of wildfires during 2018, which was a particularly devastating year for wildfires. In the map below, you are able to
    visualize the fires of 2018 through data taken by a NASA satellite. You can scroll on your own to focus on a particular time of the year, or just watch
    the animation on autoplay. The points that appear on the map are the force radiative power measure in mW per unit area. The larger and more red spots indicate
    more powerful wildfires detected at that location.

          The months in the summer are typically the most catastrophic for wildfires and 2018 was no different. Ordered by "Month", the distribution is Gaussian-like, with lowest
          acres burned occuring at the beginning and end of the year (the winter months). Into Spring, the total acres burned starts to pick up and then explodes in summer.
          July and August alone account for ~50% of the acres burned that year. Then as the fall comes, the burned acres drop back down heading toward another winter. Change the
          drop down menu to "Order" and see the absolute order of highest and lowest burn months.

      <p id="intro" style="margin: 10px 0 0 0">
        Over the past three decades, the number of acres burned every year has statistically been increasing. Between 1992-1996, an average of
        3.3 million acres burned per year due to wild fires. Two decades later, between 2014-2018 that average doubles to 7.5 million acres per
        year. The cause could be related to climate change, which has created a warmer world with drier summers which lead to more fires.

<h2>Design Decisions</h2>
<p style="font-size: 16px">We decide to continue to work on the the wild fire dataset. This time, we would like to add more interactive features into the
    visualization such as zoom in et al. The balck background was used to get a clear contrast with the fire that is encoded with a red color.
    The size and color of the data points are related to the fire strength, which provide direct comparison among the fires. The scrubber was kept in order to see the change in the development of wild fire all over US.
    The zoom in feature allows people to select the region they are interested in to get more information. For example, you can choose California and see clearly which place had that fire.
    In addition, we choose to add another map which displays the corresponding total burned areas in each state. This feature will provide information on which states have the most severe wide fire though we might have know it would be California. </p>

<h2>Development Process</h2>
    <p style="font-size: 16px">
    The final project was baesd on the previous A3 assignment. The visualization uses the wildfire dataset with additioanl data such as the total burned acres and the causes for the corresponding wildfires.
    We kept the map and scurbber feature in this final project. Additionally, we decided to add more interactive features into this map such as zoom et al. When a  State is clicked in the map, it will be enlarged and shows up in the center,
    which is convenient for detailed analysis. Besides, the aupacity of the data points were changed so that data points can be differentiated from each other
    when zoomed in. You can also drag the map to the region you are interested.
    As mentioned, the total burned acres are included in the final project. We decided to visualize this data suing a barchart for clarity. You can also interact with this bar chart by sorting the data.
    For example, you can choose Month or sort the burned acres in a descending order. It is easier to draw the conclusion that summuer season has the most sever wild fires.
    How would the wild fire distributed spatially? In order to understand this, we again chosed the map to plot out the total burned acres in the map. It is claer that
    West coast has the most wilkd fires. Besides, we added the Top 50 most severe wild fire in the United States in 2018.
    Lastly, we are curious what the causes for those fires. So we chosed to use the radial chart to visualize. It is surprising to know that most fires are actually caused by human.
